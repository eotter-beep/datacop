Index registers
Control registers
Segment registers
General Purpose Registers#
Register	Usage	Description
rax/r0	accumulator	used for input/output and most arithmetic instructions
return value	holds function return value
syscall number	holds syscall number argument for syscall instruction
rbx/r3	base for index addressing	used as memory address base for indexed addressing
rcx/r1	counter for iteration	used for holding loop count in loops
this	storing this pointer in c++
rdx/r2	data	used in arithmetic and I/O operations
rdi/r7	destination index	used in stream operations e.g. stosb
rsi/r6	source index	used in stream operations e.g. lodsb
rsp/r4	Stack pointer	points to the top of the stack
rbp/r5	Frame pointer	points to the frame's base of stack
rn	Numbered (n=8..15)

rip	instruction pointer	points to next instruction to execute
Control Registers#
Register	Description
CF	carry flag condition code register
ZF	zero flag condition code register
SF	sign flag condition code register
OF	overflow flag condition code register
Condition Code registers are single bit registers
implicitly set by arithmetic instructions
Ex: addl a,b where t is result value
CF set if unsigned overflow
ZF set if result is zero
SF set if result < 0
OF set if signed overflow (a>0 && b>0 && t<0) || (a<0 && b<0 && t>=0)
explicitly set by compare instruction
cmp a,b uses sets same flags as a-b instruction but without setting destination
Segment Registers#
Register	Description
CS	Code segment
SS	Stack segment
DS	Data segment
ES	Extra data segment
FS	Points to Thread Information Block (TIB)
GS	Extra data segment
Register Operands#
Operand	Description	
Immediate	numeric constant value	0x234 or 48
Register	general purpose register	rax
Memory	value stored at [reg + reg*scale + offset] address	scale is 1, 2, 4, or 8 only
value stored at [offset]	[2344]
value stored at [reg]	[rax+4] or C analogue of *(rax+4)
value stored at [reg + offset]	[rax+4] or C analogue of *(rax+4)
value stored at [reg + reg*scale]	[rax+4] or C analogue of *(rax+4)

call instruction pushes the return address (8 bytes) which unaligns rsp
must manually align by pushing or subtracting 8 from rsp
